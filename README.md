Branch: Electronics and Communication Engineering

Hello, I am Sameer Mehta and I am from Sirsa, Haryana. I am currently a 1st year B.Tech. student in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am currently a member of GameDev and Esports club as an Esports Executive and also a member of Xpressions. Also, I love playing basketball and listening to music in my free time. I worked under many modules in Spardha, Kriti and Manthan, some of which include: GameDev module, Robotics module, Dramatics module, Content Creation module, etc. It was the best learning experience in my life.

Open source is the most essential tool that comes into picture when working in team. I came to know about open source during Kriti 2023 in which we used github to work simultaneously on the project. Also, I believe that Github is the best source to practice real work. You can contribute to whatever you know without any limitations. This helps in practicing the already learnt stuffs and also help in learning new things.
